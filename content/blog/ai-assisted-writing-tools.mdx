## The Misconception

When people hear "AI writing tool," they imagine software that writes stories for you. That's not what NeoByteWriter does. Not even close.

## What NeoByteWriter Actually Does

NeoByteWriter is an organizational tool for authors — specifically, for those writing complex narratives with deep worldbuilding. Think of it as a story secretary that never forgets a detail.

### Character Tracking

Every character you create is tracked: their relationships, their arcs, their physical descriptions, their motivations. When you introduce a character in chapter 47 who was last mentioned in chapter 12, Writer remembers everything about them.

### Worldbuilding Management

Magic systems, political structures, geography, languages, timelines — all managed in a structured format that's always accessible while you write. No more flipping between reference documents.

### Consistency Checking

The AI reads your manuscript alongside your world bible and flags potential inconsistencies. Did a character's eye color change between chapters? Did a location's distance contradict earlier descriptions? Writer catches it.

### Plot Thread Visualization

Complex stories have dozens of plot threads running simultaneously. Writer tracks them visually, showing which threads are active, which are dormant, and which might have been accidentally dropped.

## The Philosophy

AI should handle the operational burden of writing complex fiction. The creative decisions — the voice, the themes, the emotional beats, the surprise twists — those belong entirely to the human author.

Every line of prose in your novel should be yours. Writer just makes sure you never lose track of the world you built around it.
